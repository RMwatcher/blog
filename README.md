This project involves building a blog post using node.js, express.js, ejs as well as styling using CSS.

The features includes:
- Post Creation
- Post Viewing
- Post Update/Delete
- Styling

A user should be able to create a new post, view all available posts, edit and delete posts as needed and be well-styled and responsive to ensure good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

This application should also have a good UX/UI, use of colors, spacing and other considerations such as contrast, readability, alt text with a minimalistic approach as to not overwhelm the user with too many colors or graphics.

Graphics should be kept to a minimum as they should be considered a back drop and not to distract the user from the content of the application and it's purpose.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my working knowledge of node.js, express.js, ejs and other front or back-end knowledge.
