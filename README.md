This project involves building a blog post using node.js, express.js, ejs. Styling will use the combination of CSS and Bootstrap.

The features includes:

- Post Creation
- Post Viewing
- Post Update/Delete
- Styling

A user should be able to create a new post, view all available posts, edit and delete posts as needed and be well-styled and responsive to ensure good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Since this project doesn't use a database, the posts will not be saved when they return to the blog.

This application should also have a good UX/UI, use of colors, spacing and other considerations such as contrast, readability, alt text with a minimalistic approach as to not overwhelm the user with too many colors or graphics. A combination of CSS and Bootstrap will be used for not only styling but to also make the site more responsive for mobile and desktop screens.

Graphics and images should be kept to a minimum as they should be considered a back drop and not to distract the user from the content of the application and it's purpose.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my working knowledge of node.js, express.js, ejs, json, and other front and back-end knowledge.

Side note: AI was used in the creation of this blog. It's only used to help with functionality and to fill in the gaps of knowledge especially for the following back-end languages:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Ejs
- Json
